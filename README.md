# Updivision Blog test App

**Tasks are in the Projects tab of this repository.**

*Current Theme version*: Argon v1.0.10. More info at https://www.creative-tim.com/product/argon-dashboard-laravel.

## Prerequisites

If you don't already have an Apache local environment with PHP and MySQL, use one of the following links:

 - Windows: https://updivision.com/blog/post/beginner-s-guide-to-setting-up-your-local-development-environment-on-windows
 - Linux: https://howtoubuntu.org/how-to-install-lamp-on-ubuntu
 - Mac: https://wpshout.com/quick-guides/how-to-install-mamp-on-your-mac/

Also, you will need to install Composer: https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md   
And Laravel: https://laravel.com/docs/5.8/installation

## Installation

1. Clone the repositoyry to your working folder and cd into it
2. Install dependencies via `composer install`. 
3. Add configuration data to `.env` file.
4. Run `php artisan migrate --seed` to create basic users table

## Usage

Register a user or login using **admin@updivision.com** and **secret** and start testing the preset (make sure to run the migrations and seeders for these credentials to be available).

Besides the dashboard and the auth pages this preset also has a user management example and an edit profile page. All the necessary files (controllers, requests, views) are installed out of the box and all the needed routes are added to `routes/web.php`. Keep in mind that all of the features can be viewed once you login using the credentials provided above or by registering your own user. 

### Dashboard

You can access the dashboard either by using the "**Dashboard**" link in the left sidebar or by adding **/home** in the url. 

### Profile edit

You have the option to edit the current logged in user's profile (change name, email and password). To access this page just click the "**User profile**" link in the left sidebar or by adding **/profile** in the url.

The `App\Htttp\Controlers\ProfileController` handles the update of the user information. 

```
public function update(ProfileRequest $request)
{
    auth()->user()->update($request->all());

    return back()->withStatus(__('Profile successfully updated.'));
}
```

Also you shouldn't worry about entering wrong data in the inputs when editing the profile, validation rules were added to prevent this (see `App\Http\Requests\ProfileRequest`). If you try to change the password you will see that other validation rules were added in `App\Http\Requests\PasswordRequest`. Notice that in this file you have a custom validation rule that can be found in `App\Rules\CurrentPasswordCheckRule`.

```
public function rules()
{
    return [
        'old_password' => ['required', 'min:6', new CurrentPasswordCheckRule],
        'password' => ['required', 'min:6', 'confirmed', 'different:old_password'],
        'password_confirmation' => ['required', 'min:6'],
    ];
}
```

### User management

The preset comes with a user management option out of the box. To access this click the "**User Management**" link in the left sidebar or add **/user** to the url.
The first thing you will see is the listing of the existing users. You can add new ones by clicking the "**Add user**" button (above the table on the right). On the Add user page you will see the form that allows you to do this. All pages are generate using blade templates:

```
<div class="form-group{{ $errors->has('name') ? ' has-danger' : '' }}">
    <label class="form-control-label" for="input-name">{{ __('Name') }}</label>
    <input type="text" name="name" id="input-name" class="form-control form-control-alternative{{ $errors->has('name') ? ' is-invalid' : '' }}" placeholder="{{ __('Name') }}" value="{{ old('name') }}" required autofocus>

    @if ($errors->has('name'))
        <span class="invalid-feedback" role="alert">
            <strong>{{ $errors->first('name') }}</strong>
        </span>
    @endif
</div>
```

Also validation rules were added so you will know exactely what to enter in the form fields (see `App\Http\Requests\UserRequest`). Note that these validation rules also apply for the user edit option.

```
public function rules()
{
    return [
        'name' => [
            'required', 'min:3'
        ],
        'email' => [
            'required', 'email', Rule::unique((new User)->getTable())->ignore($this->route()->user->id ?? null)
        ],
        'password' => [
            $this->route()->user ? 'nullable' : 'required', 'confirmed', 'min:6'
        ]
    ];
}
```

Once you add more users, the list will get bigger and for every user you will have edit and delete options (access these options by clicking the three dotted menu that appears at the end of every line). 

All the sample code for the user management can be found in `App\Http\Controllers\UserController`. See store method example bellow:

```
public function store(UserRequest $request, User $model)
{
    $model->create($request->merge(['password' => Hash::make($request->get('password'))])->all());

    return redirect()->route('user.index')->withStatus(__('User successfully created.'));
}
```
